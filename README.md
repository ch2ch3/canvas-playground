Canvas Playground
=================
Experimental playground for all things Canvas and KineticJS related.

To see a map of the world plotted from the geolocation coordinates of ~30 000 tweets, open `index.html`.

To see semantic zooming in action (maintaining the size of a node while scaling the space in between nodes), open `semantic-zoom.html`.
